# Rubik-s-Cube-Solver
Rubik's Cube Solver built in Java using Jswing and CSV storage. All-in-one desktop app that allows for the user to solve their current cube, generate scrambles, and keep times of their runs.
This solver mimics Kociemba's Algorithm to solve the cube in 20-23 moves (not fully optimized).
